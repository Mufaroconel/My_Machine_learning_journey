# Difference Between Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** focuses on creating intelligent machines capable of tasks requiring human-like intelligence. This includes visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and natural language processing. AI involves developing algorithms and systems that can reason, learn, and make decisions based on input data.

**Machine Learning (ML)**, a subfield of AI, involves teaching machines to learn from data without explicit programming. ML algorithms identify patterns and trends in data to make predictions and decisions. It's used to build predictive models, classify data, and recognize patterns, essential for many AI applications.

AI and ML have the potential to transform industries and improve lives. AI diagnoses diseases, detects fraud, analyzes financial data, and optimizes processes. ML personalizes content, improves customer experiences, and helps solve environmental challenges.

Despite benefits, AI and ML present risks, including job displacement and ethical concerns. It's crucial to approach their development responsibly and ethically.

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)

AI, comprising "Artificial" and "Intelligence," aims to imbue machines with human-like capabilities. It's implemented in systems and involves training computers to perform tasks humans currently excel at.

## Machine Learning (ML)

ML enables machines to learn and improve from experience without explicit programming. It generates programs by integrating input and output, improving performance over time.
