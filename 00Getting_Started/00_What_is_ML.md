# What is Machine Learning

### Introduction to Machine Learning

Arthur Samuel, a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence and computer gaming, coined the term **“Machine Learning”**. He defined machine learning as:
> *"A field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed."*

In simpler terms, Machine Learning (ML) can be explained as automating and improving the learning process of computers based on their experiences without being explicitly programmed, i.e., without any human assistance. 

The process begins with:
1. **Data Collection:** Gathering good quality data.
2. **Training:** Training our machines (computers) by building machine learning models using the data and various algorithms.

The choice of algorithms depends on the type of data and the task we are trying to automate.


# How Machine Learning Algorithms Work


### Machine Learning Workflow

**1. Forward Pass:**
   - In the Forward Pass, the machine learning algorithm takes in input data and produces an output. Depending on the model algorithm it computes the predictions.

**2. Loss Function:**
   - The loss function, also known as the error or cost function, is used to evaluate the accuracy of the predictions made by the model. The function compares the predicted output of the model to the actual output and calculates the difference between them. This difference is known as error or loss. The goal of the model is to minimize the error or loss function by adjusting its internal parameters.

**3. Model Optimization Process:**
   - The model optimization process is the iterative process of adjusting the internal parameters of the model to minimize the error or loss function. This is done using an optimization algorithm, such as gradient descent. The optimization algorithm calculates the gradient of the error function with respect to the model’s parameters and uses this information to adjust the parameters to reduce the error. The algorithm repeats this process until the error is minimized to a satisfactory level.

Once the model has been trained and optimized on the training data, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data. The accuracy of the model’s predictions can be evaluated using various performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Machine Learning Lifecycle

The lifecycle of a machine learning project involves a series of steps that include:

1. **Study the Problems:** 
   - The first step is to study the problem. This step involves understanding the business problem and defining the objectives of the model.

2. **Data Collection:** 
   - When the problem is well-defined, we can collect the relevant data required for the model. The data could come from various sources such as databases, APIs, or web scraping.

3. **Data Preparation:** 
   - When our problem-related data is collected, then it is a good idea to check the data properly and make it in the desired format so that it can be used by the model to find the hidden patterns. This can be done in the following steps:
     - Data cleaning
     - Data Transformation
     - Explanatory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering
     - Split the dataset for training and testing.

4. **Model Selection:** 
   - The next step is to select the appropriate machine learning algorithm that is suitable for our problem. This step requires knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of different algorithms. Sometimes we use multiple models and compare their results and select the best model as per our requirements.

5. **Model building and Training:** 
   - After selecting the algorithm, we have to build the model. 
     - In the case of traditional machine learning building model is easy it is just a few hyperparameter tunings.
     - In the case of deep learning, we have to define layer-wise architecture along with input and output size, number of nodes in each layer, loss function, gradient descent optimizer, etc.
     - After that model is trained using the preprocessed dataset.

6. **Model Evaluation:** 
   - Once the model is trained, it can be evaluated on the test dataset to determine its accuracy and performance using different techniques like classification report, F1 score, precision, recall, ROC Curve, Mean Square error, absolute error, etc.

7. **Model Tuning:** 
   - Based on the evaluation results, the model may need to be tuned or optimized to improve its performance. This involves tweaking the hyperparameters of the model.

8. **Deployment:** 
   - Once the model is trained and tuned, it can be deployed in a production environment to make predictions on new data. This step requires integrating the model into an existing software system or creating a new system for the model.

9. **Monitoring and Maintenance:** 
   - Finally, it is essential to monitor the model’s performance in the production environment and perform maintenance tasks as required. This involves monitoring for data drift, retraining the model as needed, and updating the model as new data becomes available.
